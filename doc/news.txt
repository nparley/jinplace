== Version 0.10.0 improved api ==
'''20 July 2013''' The api is improved and a section added to the
documentation about writing a plugin. The API is now close to a
first complete version.

== data-nil changes to data-placeholder ==
'''10 July 2013''' The setting that used to be known as 'data-nil' is
now changed to 'data-placeholder'. The old name will still work for
a while, probably until the API is declared stable with 1.0.

Naturally the same is true of the config setting which is now
'placeholder'

<pre code=js>
$('.editable').jinplace({
	placeholder: '[Click!]'
});
</pre>
