== Version 1.0.0-rc.2 ==
<b>12 Sep 2013</b>
There is no intention to break backward compatibility so we
are releasing as v1.0.0.

There has only every been one deliberate change which was data-nil to
data-placeholder.  Now for v1 the old data-nil name is being removed.

== Version 0.11.0 submit function ==
<b>12 Aug 2013</b> Add user defined submit function so that you
have complete control over what happens when the edited data is
submitted.

Likewise there is also a user defined load function which is called
to fetch data for editing when there is a loadurl defined.

Fixed bug where the element id was not being submitted

== Version 0.10.1 improved api ==
'''22 July 2013''' If ok and/or cancel buttons are added, they have a css
class of jip-button and jip-ok-button or jip-cancel-button as
appropriate.

API fix for value() methods that return an integer or something other
than a string or plain object.

Bug fix by sourcecat (@github) for textOnly and placeholder options.
Tests added for them too.

== Version 0.10.0 improved api ==
'''20 July 2013''' The api is improved and a section added to the
documentation about writing a plugin. The API is now close to a
first complete version.

== data-nil changes to data-placeholder ==
'''10 July 2013''' The setting that used to be known as 'data-nil' is
now changed to 'data-placeholder'. The old name will still work for
a while, probably until the API is declared stable with 1.0.

Naturally the same is true of the config setting which is now
'placeholder'

<pre code=js>
$('.editable').jinplace({
	placeholder: '[Click!]'
});
</pre>
