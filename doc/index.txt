==Introduction==

jinplace is a jQuery plugin that is used to make sections of text
on a page editable directly from the page.
Editing starts by clicking on the text. It then turns into an
input field where the new text can be typed.
Clicking outside the field will submit the new new text and once
a reply has been received, the input field is removed and the
new text replaces it.

That is the basic flow, but there are a number of options to change
this. You can have explicit OK and cancel buttons and a separate
button to start editing for example.

==Include javascript files==
As this is a jQuery plugin, you must include a version of jQuery
(versions 1.7+ should work) first.

Download the latest version of this plugin
[https://bitbucket.org/itinken/jinplace/downloads/jinplace-0.9.1.min.js jinplace-0.9.1.min.js].
Go to the [https://bitbucket.org/itinken/jinplace/downloads download directory] for
other versions or for an un-minified debug/development version of the file and source
distributions.

== Mark up the page ==

You should read this section in conjunction with
the [https://bitbucket.org/itinken/inplace/wiki/demo.html demo]
which is structured like a mini tutorial for some of the
basic mark up attributes.

<pre code=html>
Title: <span data-url="/update_title.php">Hello world</span>
</pre>

See the [https://bitbucket.org/itinken/inplace/wiki/Attributes complete list of attributes]
and settings.
